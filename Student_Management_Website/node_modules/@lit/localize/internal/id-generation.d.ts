/**
 * Generate a unique ID for a lit-localize message.

 * Example:
 *   Template: html`Hello <b>${who}</b>!`
 *     Params: ["Hello <b>", "</b>!"], true
 *     Output: h82ccc38d4d46eaa9
 *
 * The ID is constructed as:
 *
 *   [0]    Kind of template: [h]tml or [s]tring.
 *   [1,16] 64-bit FNV-1a hash hex digest of the template strings, as UTF-16
 *          code points, delineated by an ASCII "record separator" character.
 *
 * We choose FNV-1a because:
 *
 *   1. It's pretty fast (e.g. much faster than SHA-1).
 *   2. It's pretty small (0.25 KiB minified + brotli).
 *   3. We don't require cryptographic security, and 64 bits should give
 *      sufficient collision resistance for any one application. Worst
 *      case, we will always detect collisions during analysis.
 *   4. We can't use Web Crypto API (e.g. SHA-1), because it's asynchronous.
 *   5. It's a well known non-cryptographic hash with implementations in many
 *      languages.
 *   6. There was an existing JavaScript implementation that doesn't require
 *      BigInt, for IE11 compatibility.
